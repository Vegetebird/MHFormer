## Updates
- 05/12/2022: The pretrained models of 81-frames, 243-frames, 351-frames are released!
- 03/24/2022: Demo and in-the-wild inference code are released! 

## Installation

- Create a conda environment: ```conda create -n mhformer python=3.7```
- Download cudatoolkit=11.0 from [here](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-11.0-download-archive) and install 
- ```pip3 install torch==1.7.1+cu110 torchvision==0.8.2+cu110 -f https://download.pytorch.org/whl/torch_stable.html```
- ```pip3 install -r requirements.txt```
  
## Dataset setup

Please download the dataset from [Human3.6M](http://vision.imar.ro/human3.6m/) website and refer to [VideoPose3D](https://github.com/facebookresearch/VideoPose3D) to set up the Human3.6M dataset ('./dataset' directory). 
Or you can download the processed data from [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/112GPdRC9IEcwcJRyrLJeYw9_YV4wLdKC?usp=sharing). 

```bash
${POSE_ROOT}/
|-- dataset
|   |-- data_3d_h36m.npz
|   |-- data_2d_h36m_gt.npz
|   |-- data_2d_h36m_cpn_ft_h36m_dbb.npz
```

## Download pretrained model

The pretrained model can be found in [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1UWuaJ_nE19x2aM-Th221UpdhRPSCFwZa?usp=sharing), please download it and put it in the './checkpoint/pretrained' directory. 

## Test the model

To test on a 351-frames pretrained model on Human3.6M:

```bash
python main.py --test --previous_dir 'checkpoint/pretrained/351' --frames 351
```

Here, we compare our MHFormer with recent state-of-the-art methods on Human3.6M dataset. Evaluation metric is Mean Per Joint Position Error (MPJPE) in mmâ€‹. 


|   Models    |  MPJPE   |
| :---------: | :------: |
| VideoPose3D |   46.8   |
| PoseFormer  |   44.3   |
|  MHFormer   | **43.0** |


## Train the model

To train a 351-frames model on Human3.6M:

```bash
python main.py --frames 351 --batch_size 128
```

The batch size can be changed depending on your machine. 

## Demo
First, you need to download YOLOv3 and HRNet pretrained models [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1_ENAMOsPM7FXmdYRbkwbFHgzQq_B_NQA?usp=sharing) and put it in the './demo/lib/checkpoint' directory. 
Then, you need to put your in-the-wild videos in the './demo/video' directory. 

Run the command below:
```bash
python demo/vis.py --video sample_video.mp4
```

Sample demo output:
